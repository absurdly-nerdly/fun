# Sound Effects Directory

This directory contains sound effects for the Balloon Puff game:

- `puff.wav` - Playing when the balloon puffs up (spacebar/click)
- `game-over.wav` - Playing when game over is triggered

Note: Sound files need to be added here in WAV format. They should be:
- Short (< 1 second for puff, < 2 seconds for game over)
- Retro-style 8-bit sounds
- Small file size (< 100KB each)
